This was a final project for the AA in Mobile+Web Design for Berkeley City College.

Stick with it - Tahitian Drumming via PC/Laptop

The age old idea that “practice makes perfect,” is an accurate idiom for Tahitian drumming students. To achieve continuous success in
this art form, one needs to practice drum beats repeatedly so that one is prepared to harmonize with fellow drum members. In order to
get to the level of harmony with the drummer self and others, one must practice, study, and perfect their timing, tempo, and stamina in
their drumming. Tahitian cultural arts is special for me, so I thought I’d use programming as a means to translate this very fun,
vibrant, and beautiful culture via drumming app.

“Stick with it” is a project aimed for Tahitian drumming students who want to reinforce the concepts they’ve learned in their drumming
class by practicing through your keyboard. A basic Tahitian drum set was built for this app. It comprises of the wooden to’ere (toh-erh-
eh) and tariparau (tah-ree-pa-rao). These handmade drums are usually imported from French Polynesia. The minimum cost for this basic set
begins at $700 USD, and if you’re lucky and kind-hearted, you are gifted a drum. I chose to build this because it serves as a useful
tool for those who cannot afford a Tahitian drum set, and practice their art. These drums are also very loud. An additional motivation
for creating this app is to provide a harmonious “sound space” between the drum student and their relatives, neighbors, and/or
significant others. 🖖
