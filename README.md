This was a final project for the AA in Mobile+Web Design for Berkeley City College. Revised final paper below.

Stick with it - Tahitian Drumming via PC/Laptop
The age old idea that ‚Äúpractice makes perfect,‚Äù is an accurate idiom for Tahitian drumming students. To achieve continuous success in
this art form, one needs to practice drum beats repeatedly so that one is prepared to harmonize with fellow drum members. In order to
get to the level of harmony with the drummer self and others, one must practice, study, and perfect their timing, tempo, and stamina in
their drumming. Tahitian cultural arts is special for me, so I thought I‚Äôd use programming as a means to translate this very fun,
vibrant, and beautiful culture via drumming app.

‚ÄúStick with it‚Äù is a project aimed for Tahitian drumming students who want to reinforce the concepts they‚Äôve learned in their drumming
class by practicing through your keyboard. A basic Tahitian drum set was built for this app. It comprises of the wooden to‚Äôere (toh-erh-
eh) and tariparau (tah-ree-pa-rao). These handmade drums are usually imported from French Polynesia. The minimum cost for this basic set
begins at $700 USD, and if you‚Äôre lucky and kind-hearted, you are gifted a drum. I chose to build this because it serves as a useful
tool for those who cannot afford a Tahitian drum set, and practice their art. These drums are also very loud. An additional motivation
for creating this app is to provide a harmonious ‚Äúsound space‚Äù between the drum student and their relatives, neighbors, and/or
significant others. üññ 

To maintain order and direction of this project, a weekly hurdles spreadsheet was formed. The tutorials received during instructor
office hours and class time helped solidify and reinforce concepts, especially in times of doubt (this happened very often for me). I 
experienced some weeks of great defeat, where the upkeep of weekly hurdles were not achievable. It was easiest to quit. I humbly respect 
the availability and energy of instructors who follow through, and encourage positively. The availability of the instructors offline 
through online conferencing, and in person baffles me-- and I am very thankful for their time and friendly patience. Their encouragement 
helped make this project achievable, as well as fun and motivating to continue to follow through. I felt encouraged and positively 
supported.

The technologies explored were HTML5, CSS, vanilla Javascript, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), and WebRTC (Real-time Communication)
functions. Additional technologies include Adobe Illustrator, Sublime Text Editor, Google Drive, my Samsung Phone to rip through the
audio, and numerous medium articles and StackOverflow to finecomb through instructor concepts. 
For HTML5, I have learned more about the <audio> <video> elements, and the amount of freedom one can have using the data-* attribute. My
knowledge on CSS was reinforced as I ventured into a course from Wes Bos called What the Flexbox. I found Flexbox to be extremely useful 
for the ‚Äòflexibility‚Äô of positioning objects, although had to use margins, too. I‚Äôm still unsure how to tie these concepts together, but
continue the discovery. In addition, I played with the transform properties to give an effect of the drums being hit. This was a
workaround solution since I made some attempts with Snap.svg, and did not get the results I had hoped, for the amount of time I had 
allocated to push this project. 

I learned how C++ is used to build Node.js which operates using Javascript. I‚Äôve learned the keyword, ‚Äúhigh level language,‚Äù in
programming per se. It is fascinating to gain a thorough introductory concept of how much goes into using Javascript, and makes me
enthusiastic of the amount of work forward. Of the many Javascript concepts learned, the concept I come to find useful for the longevity
of learning Javascript is the execution stack, and becoming familiar of semantic versioning (semver). It‚Äôs like knowing which cooking
tools you have, and how many variations of a cuisine ‚Äúdish‚Äù has been made.

WebRTC was pretty fun and encouraging to learn!! I went through this codelab tutorial and used the getUserMedia(), establish peer
connections via RTCPeerConnections. I used these to establish a ‚ÄúCall‚Äù and Video Hangout for a way to establish a call to your 
‚Äòinstructor.‚Äô For future improvements, I‚Äôd like to discover how to create a video gallery repository. In addition, a way for drummers to
share online space.

Overall, as a designer student, I can see benefits of having a strong technical background, which I think and feel I am achieving in
this course. After spending a reasonable amount of time as a marketer in the fintech industry, I‚Äôve come to realize a strong technical
background will allow for more opportunities to develop connections and language to build between roles. I also wanted to credit
Nemenzo‚Äôs Te Fare Polynesian dance studio who found this project cool, and for allowing me to record and use their drum beats. 
I also indebted and thank Sefa Pumphrey, who taught me the basics and style of drumming. His lessons built a great foundation when
exploring other drum spaces. The approach he taught us was to remain humble, and keep striving to learn more in our craft, while
remembering the foundations.
